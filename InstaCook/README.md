# InstaCook

Created by: Karthika Thiruvallur and Raghav Thiruvallur

My project aims to find a combination of recipes based on the 3 vegetables which user entered does web wide recipe search and displays the URL choices done using Python & Libraries. 


For example, if a user enters three vegetables: Tomato, Carrot, and  beans, you will be given the urls of the different recipes combinations of those vegetables.
